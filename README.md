# Data Question 5 - Introduction to the Tidyverse

### Scenario
<p>You are a team of data journalists at a major online news organization. The news room staff has taken an interest in Tennessee, and has asked your team to develop a picture of Tennesseans and how they differ across (and within) counties, particularly in regard to socioeconomic factors like education and income. Your assignment is to learn more about educational and socioeconomic factors for Tennesseans and to report your findings.</p>

### Questions:
1. Explore the education datasets. Look at the [the Department of Education website](https://www.tn.gov/education/data/data-downloads.html) to bring in additional data. For example, it might be useful to download the District to County Crosswalk so that you can match each district to its county. What patterns emerge when you explore the data? Create a variety of different types of plots to visualize your data (histogram, bee swarm, box plot, maps, etc...).

2. Bring in at least one additional dataset that you think will add further context to the educational outcomes data. Consider pulling from the census or exploring the [NCES](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/ccddata.asp). If time allows, bring in multiple additional datasets.

3. Build at least one model (your choice of which type) to predict graduation rates by county. Be creative in engineering new features or adding additional data that you might think add predictive power. Think about socioeconomic factors that might be driving educational outcomes. Inspect the feature importances from your model and report the factors that seem to have the most impact on the educational outcomes.
